# NVL tenancy events

This document describes the implemented source behavior. Acceptance is exercised by the owning package suites and Core committed-event regression tests; current release execution evidence is tracked in consumer-readiness.md. The authoritative machine-readable schema is [event-catalog.json](../resources/event-catalog.json), catalog version `1`. Event `schemaVersion` is independent of catalog version.

This package declares **no domain events**. Context/resolution/queue ownership infrastructure declares no domain events. Neutral runtime types live in Core.

## Deferred acceptance checks

Final testing must compare catalog types/defaults/aliases with actual classes, recursively inspect producer payloads, and prove source outer commit, nested rollback, unrelated connection independence and retry behavior without an uncommitted test-harness transaction. Where applicable it must cover legacy exact/cached/queued listeners, canonical fakes and wildcard delivery, tenant capture, package no-op guards and observational failure containment. This document does not report those checks as passing.

## Consumer event assertions

Use the canonical event class listed in the catalog for `Event::fake([...])` and `Event::assertDispatched(...)`. Laravel fake filters compare the emitted class name; an old alias import does not rename that canonical object. Legacy exact listeners are bridged at delivery time through Laravel’s native dispatcher. Keep compatibility listener tests on their exact legacy name, and migrate suffix-specific wildcards to canonical names.
