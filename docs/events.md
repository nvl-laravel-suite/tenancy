# NVL tenancy events

This document describes the implemented source behavior. Executable acceptance proof is pending the final testing phase. The authoritative machine-readable schema is [event-catalog.json](../resources/event-catalog.json), catalog version `1`. Event `schemaVersion` is independent of catalog version.

This package declares **no domain events**. Context/resolution/queue ownership infrastructure declares no domain events. Neutral runtime types live in Core.

## Deferred acceptance checks

Final testing must compare catalog types/defaults/aliases with actual classes, recursively inspect producer payloads, and prove source outer commit, nested rollback, unrelated connection independence and retry behavior without an uncommitted test-harness transaction. Where applicable it must cover legacy exact/cached/queued listeners, canonical fakes and wildcard delivery, tenant capture, package no-op guards and observational failure containment. This document does not report those checks as passing.
